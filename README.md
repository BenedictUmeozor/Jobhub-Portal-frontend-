# Jobhub portal

Welcome to Jobhub!

JobHub is a practice project I created with passion and dedication. This application aims to provide a simplified job application platform where users can apply for jobs and employers can post job listings. As a beginner, this project serves as a stepping stone in the exciting world of software development for me, offering opportunities to learn, experiment, and grow.

Instead of relying on a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS, I decided to utilize custom CSS for developing this application. This choice allowed me to delve deeper into CSS and gain expertise in responsive web design.

On the React side of things, this project made me realize the importance of learning Redux. While I used the Context API here, it had its shortcomings due to deeply nested components, resulting in unnecessary re-renders when a top-level state changed. Nevertheless, this experience enhanced my understanding of state management in React.

Additionally, I made effective use of React Router in this project, leading to significant improvements in my understanding of routing concepts.

Working on this application has been an enlightening journey, honing my skills in both CSS and React development, and motivating me to explore more efficient state management solutions like Redux for future projects.


In future projects of this size, i plan to use redux and redux toolkit. I will
